The TestConstructor file shows how it will be displayed for output. The biggest thing I need to finish my portion is the 
variables used to obtain the information. In order to call the proper information, I will need the NAME OF PITCHER and the YEAR
they want the stats on. I do not need information about the team, as it is already included in the pitcher profile. Let me know if you need
anything.

Information that needs to be passed from fx to constructor:

1. Name from Scanner

2. Pitchers Name --> to construct myPitcher instance

3. Pitcher Year --> determine which method to call/ how to create array

Here is the complete list of information that should be on the front end -->

1. Enter users name from scanner

2. Select Team, which should then unlock the pitcher options. Cant select pitcher before team.

3. Select Pitcher, unlocks year. 

4. Year, unlocks submit

5. A way to restart to edit selections before submission

6. A way to exit
